Homework Assignment 1

**Problem 1**
=============

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform \[0,5\] distribution.
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2.
-   A (length-10) character vector.
-   A (length-10) factor vector.

``` r
## set the seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(123)

## create data frame with four vectors 
problem_one_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5), 
  vec_logical = (vec_numeric > 2),
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Diana", "Ballesteros", "Gonzalez", "and", "I", "love", "tacos"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple", "indigo", "black", "grey"))
) 
```

-   The mean for the a random sample of size 10from a uniform \[0,5\] distribution is 2.8912375. I was able to get a mean value for this vector because it averaged the 10 random numbers that it reproduced.

-   The mean for a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 is 0.8. I was able to get a mean value for this vector because it calculated the proportion of true statements out of the 10.

-   The mean of a (length-10) character vector is NA because you cannot take an average of character values.

-   The mean of a (length-10) factor vector is NA because you cannot take an average of categorical variables.

### Explanation for what happens when your run as.numeric with the logical, character, and factor vectors

-   For the logical vector, I had not problem because it converted the true and false statements to numbers where, 0 = False and 1 = True.
-   For the character vector, I received a warning message stating "NAs introduced by coercion."
-   For the factor vector, you get random numbers assigned to each factor.

### Converting from Character to Factor to Numeric

``` r
as.factor(problem_one_df$vec_char)
```

    ##  [1] My          name        is          Diana       Ballesteros
    ##  [6] Gonzalez    and         I           love        tacos      
    ## Levels: and Ballesteros Diana Gonzalez I is love My name tacos

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(problem_one_df$vec_char))
```

    ##  [1]  8  9  6  3  2  4  1  5  7 10

For the conversion of a character to factor to numeric, I was ablw to obtain values that assigned a random number to each string of characters.

### Converting from Character to Factor to Numeric

``` r
as.character(problem_one_df$vec_factor)
```

    ##  [1] "red"    "orange" "yellow" "green"  "blue"   "orange" "purple"
    ##  [8] "indigo" "black"  "grey"

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(problem_one_df$vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

For the conversion of character to a factor to numeric, I received a warning message because it cannot produce a numeric value for a character vector.

**Problem 2**
=============

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether the x + y &gt; 0
-   A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
-   A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

``` r
##load the library 
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
##set the seed to ensure reproducibility 
set.seed(124)

##create a new df for problem two
problem_two_df = tibble(
    x = rnorm(1000),
    y = rnorm(1000), 
    vec_logical = (x + y > 0),
)
```
