Homework Assignment 1

Problem 1
=========

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform \[0,5\] distribution.
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2.
-   A (length-10) character vector.
-   A (length-10) factor vector.

``` r
set.seed(123)

## create data frame with four vectors 
problem_one_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5), 
  vec_logical = (vec_numeric > 2),
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Diana", "Ballesteros", "Gonzalez", "and", "I", "love", "tacos."),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple", "indigo", "black", "grey"))
) 
```

-   The mean for the a random sample of size 10from a uniform \[0,5\] distribution is 2.8912375. I was able to get a mean value for this vector because it averaged the 10 random numbers that it reproduced.

-   The mean for a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 is 0.8. I was able to get a mean value for this vector because it calculated the proportion of True statements to False statments.

-   The mean of a (length-10) character vector is NA because you cannot take an average of character values.

-   The mean of a (length-10) factor vector is NA because you cannot take an average of categorical variables.

Problem 2
=========

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether the x + y &gt; 0
-   A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
-   A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector
